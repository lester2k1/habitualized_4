## About Trabbit

Trabbit is a habit tracking web application project for Web Development 2.

Forming a new habit or skill is very difficult. It requires discipline, monitoring, and some form of encouragement. 
The web app is a very simple tool that will help a person tally if he is satisfied with his effort in making a new habit.

## Scope and Limitation

The app is focused on the userâ€™s own evaluation of his effort. It does not record if he was successful or not in doing the new habit.

## Feature

The web application has the following pages and/or functionalities:
- User Registration
- User LogIn
- Habit List Page
- Habit Calendar page
